Project guidelines, for reference:

Your goal is analyze a theory, hypothesis, or policy using one or more of the causal inference tools learned in this course as applied to actual data.

The first objective is to have a topic or sets of topics that you are interested in, and a policy or theory or hypothesis about them that you would like to test. We have many examples by now from class, readings, and the replications you have done and papers you have come across along the way. You do not need to constrain yourselves to the same questions you have seen. The question you chose should be easy to rhetorically motivate why it would be interesting for economists, businesses, government, etc.

The process from here will be a triangulation of a decent research question, policy variation available to use one of the applied tools, and where the data will come from.
